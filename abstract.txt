If you write web apps in Perl (perhaps using Catalyst, Mojolicious, Dancer, or
one of the other great web frameworks), you are probably already using PSGI,
but do you understand how it works and why PSGI is so amazing? You should! If
you still write web apps using CGI, then there are many reasons why you should
create your next project using a PSGI-compatible web framework.

PSGI is a specification, like CGI, that describes how web apps and web servers
can communicate. It stands for Perl web Server Gateway Interface, and the
first version of the specification was published to the CPAN on Oct 13, 2009.

This talk will go over:
* what PSGI is and how it works,
* how it differs and is better than CGI,
* what makes it so cool,
* and how you can use it to do awesome things.

You'll get the most out of this talk if you already know Perl and use it to
build web applications.
