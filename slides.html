## Agenda

- Answer "What is PSGI?"
- Examine some alternatives to PSGI.
- Examine PSGI.
- Examine Plack.

---

## What is PSGI?

### **P**erl [web] **S**erver **G**ateway **I**nterface

--
- It is an interface between Perl web applications and web servers.

--
- It is a *specification*, not code.

--
- First released to the CPAN on 13 Oct 2009.

--
- Originally written by Miyagawa.

.center[![Tatsuhiko Miyagawa](img/avatar-miyagawa.jpg)]

???
Written by **Tatsuhiko Miyagawa**, author of:
- cpanm
- carton
- way too many Perl modules on CPAN to list

--
- Inspired by WSGI (Python) and Rack (Ruby).

???
- PEP-333 (WSGI 1.0) was released on 07 Dec 2003.
- Rack 0.1 was released on 03 Mar 2007.

Despite Perl's long history of powering the web, we were well behind the curve on this.

## Extremely High-level Overview

.basic-flow[
![Basic Flow](img/basic-flow1.svg)
]

???
- PSGI is the language your app speaks in order to communicate with user agents.
  - User agents are browsers.
- I've glossed over some important details, like the fact that users don't speak PSGI.

---

## Pretty High-level Overview

.basic-flow[
![Basic Flow](img/basic-flow2.svg)
]

???
- In reality, your app speaks PSGI but user agents speak HTTP.
- You need software in the middle that can speak both, and that's usually a web server.

---

## Somewhat High-level Overview

.basic-flow[
![Basic Flow](img/basic-flow3.svg)
]

???
- In reality, most web servers don't speak PSGI. :-(
- There are "handlers" that speak both PSGI and another language that web servers do speak.
  - CGI
  - mod_perl
  - FastCGI
  - **HTTP**
- Yes, HTTP. Many modern web servers speak HTTP not only as a server but also as a client.
  - This allows them to *proxy* (act as middleman) between user agents and other servers.
- In the world of PSGI (and "Plack"), handlers are also called adapters or connectors.
- There are already adapters for every major web server.
  - Apache
  - nginx
  - IIS

## Somewhat High-level Overview

.basic-flow[
![Basic Flow](img/basic-flow4.svg)
]

???
- Notice that as we've zoomed in, the interaction between the web app and the rest has remained the
  same: PSGI.
  - From a developer perspective, the etremely high-level overview is sufficient.
  - This is one of the benefits of PSGI:
    - Write your application once and leave deployment details to devops.
    - The intrastructure details can change (swap in a different web server) and the app will still work.
    - Maybe you're both developer and system architect, but the separation between developer and
      devops is valuable.
  - In fairness, this isn't a new concept.
    - The way this has been achieved before is using a *web framework*.

---

## High-level Overview

.basic-flow[
![Basic Flow](img/basic-flow5.svg)
]

???
- A web framework makes it so your app doesn't need to speak HTTP or CGI or even PSGI.

## Word of Caution

> Writing your web application directly using [PSGI/Plack] is certainly possible but not recommended.
>
> [â€¦]
> 
> If you're writing a web application, not a framework, then you're encouraged to use one of the web
> application frameworks that support PSGI (http://plackperl.org/#frameworks), or see modules like
> HTTP::Engine to provide higher level Request and Response API on top of PSGI.
> 
> -- [Plack::Request Documentation](https://search.cpan.org/~miyagawa/Plack/lib/Plack/Request.pm)

???
- When you start learning about Plack, you'll realize that it is actually pretty capable.
  - You may start to think that everything should be developed on that level -- don't do it!
- For most stuff, you'll still want to use a web framework.
- Web frameworks often offer more convenient abstractions than raw PSGI.

---

## Why care?

???
If you're a developer writing a web app, you're probably asking why then you should care about PSGI.

--

- So that you can understand how things work.

???
- I'll never understood people who don't want to understand things.
- Knowledge is cool!
- I recommend you learn and understand as much as you can about the entire request-response cycle of
  your web app; it will help you troubleshoot when things go wrong or aren't behaving as expected.
- Be an expert!

--
- So that you can do DevOps (if you want).

???
- New skills make you more marketable.

--
- So that you understand it when you see PSGI exposed through your web framework.

--
- You can do cool things with PSGI!

???
- Even if you do most of your work using your framework, you can do some useful things with PSGI.
- We will get to some of those cool things, so hang tight.

## HTTP

---

### **H**yper**t**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol

--
- Invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, first specified as [HTTP 0.9](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html) in 1991.

--
- The IETF and W3C took over standards development, resulting in [RFC 1945](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945) ("HTTP 1.0") in 1996.

--
- [RFC 2068](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2068) ("HTTP 1.1") happened in 1997, superceded by [RFC 2616](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616) in 1999.

???
RFC 2616 was then superceded in 2014 by:
- [RFC 7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230)
- [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231)
- [RFC 7232](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232)
- [RFC 7233](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233)
- [RFC 7234](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234)
- [RFC 7235](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235)

--
- Oh yeah, and HTTP2 came out in 2015, defined in [RFC 7540](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540).

## Alternatives to PSGI

- CGI
- mod_perl
- FastCGI
- SCGI
- WSGI
- JSGI
- Rack
- ISAPI
- many more...


???
- All of these still exist, and actually all of these are still in common use.
- We're going to take a closer look at three of these.

## CGI

---

### **C**ommon **G**ateway **I**nterface

--
- Created by the NCSA in 1993.

???
- NCSA = National Center for Supercomputing Applications

--
- More formally defined in [RFC 3875](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3875) ("CGI Version 1.1") in October 2004.

---

```perl
my $client_ip = $ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'};

print "Content-Type: text/plain\n";
print "Status: 200 OK\n";

print "\n";
print "Your IP address is ${client_ip}.";
```

---

```perl
*my $client_ip = $ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'};

print "Content-Type: text/plain\n";
print "Status: 200 OK\n";

print "\n";
print "Your IP address is ${client_ip}.";
```

1. Gateway sets information about the request in the environment.

- `REQUEST_METHOD`
- `SCRIPT_NAME`
- `SERVER_NAME`
- `SERVER_PORT`
- `SERVER_PROTOCOL`
- `SERVER_SOFTWARE`
- other "protocol-specific" variables
]
]

???
- If you've done some web programming before, you're probably familiar with at least a few of these.

---

```perl
my $client_ip = $ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'};

*print "Content-Type: text/plain\n";
*print "Status: 200 OK\n";

print "\n";
print "Your IP address is ${client_ip}.";
```

1. Gateway sets information about the request in the environment.
2. Print response headers to `STDOUT`.

.condensed.marginfix[
.col[
- `Content-Type`
- `Location`
- `Status`
- other "protocol-specific" header fields
]
]

---

```perl
my $client_ip = $ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'};

print "Content-Type: text/plain\n";
print "Status: 200 OK\n";

*print "\n";
print "Your IP address is ${client_ip}.";
```

1. Gateway sets information about the request in the environment.
2. Print response headers to `STDOUT`.
3. Print newline.

---

```perl
my $client_ip = $ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'};

print "Content-Type: text/plain\n";
print "Status: 200 OK\n";

print "\n";
*print "Your IP address is ${client_ip}.";
```

1. Gateway sets information about the request in the environment.
2. Print response headers to `STDOUT`.
3. Print newline.
4. Print response document (if any).

---

```perl
my $client_ip = $ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'};

print "Content-Type: text/plain\n";
print "Status: 200 OK\n";

print "\n";
print "Your IP address is ${client_ip}.";
```

1. Gateway sets information about the request in the environment.
2. Print response headers to `STDOUT`.
3. Print newline.
4. Print response document (if any).
5. Read request document from `STDIN` (if any).

???
- CGI.pm helps cut down boilerplate by helping parse things like `QUERY_STRING` and `HTTP_COOKIE`,
  producing correctly-formatted headers, and even producing HTML.
- CGI.pm was deprecated in perl 5.20 and remove from core in perl 5.22.

TODO make a slide for this
Good:
- Conceptually simple.
- Only requires the use of the most basic and primitive program constructs (stdin, stdout, env).

Bad:
- Details can get complicated.
- Although the de facto standard for years, modern web servers are choosing to not support it
  directly any longer.
- There is too much overhead in forking and execing.

---

class:  fastcgi
layout: true

.top-right[
![FastCGI](img/fastcgi.png)
]

## FastCGI

---

### a low-overhead variation on CGI

--
- Binary protocol with support for pipelining and multiplexing.

--
- Open Market wrote the [specification](http://www.mit.edu/~yandros/doc/specs/fcgi-spec.html) on 29 Apr 1996.

???
- Open Market was an ecommerce startup based in Massachusetts.
  - Developed one of the first HTTP servers.

---

```perl
use FCGI;

my $request = FCGI::Request();

while (0 <= $request->Accept()) {
    my $client_ip = $ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'};

    print "Content-Type: text/html\n\n";
    print "Your IP address is ${client_ip}.";
}
```

---

```perl
*use FCGI;
*
*my $request = FCGI::Request();

while (0 <= $request->Accept()) {
    my $client_ip = $ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'};

    print "Content-Type: text/html\n\n";
    print "Your IP address is ${client_ip}.";
}
```

1. Use `FCGI` and instantiate an object.

---

```perl
use FCGI;

my $request = FCGI::Request();

*while (0 <= $request->Accept()) {
    my $client_ip = $ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'};

    print "Content-Type: text/html\n\n";
    print "Your IP address is ${client_ip}.";
}
```

1. Use `FCGI` and instantiate an object.
2. Loop on `Accept()` which blocks until the next request is received.

---

```perl
use FCGI;

my $request = FCGI::Request();

while (0 <= $request->Accept()) {
*   my $client_ip = $ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'};
*
*   print "Content-Type: text/html\n\n";
*   print "Your IP address is ${client_ip}.";
}
```

1. Use `FCGI` and instantiate an object.
2. Loop on `Accept()` which blocks until the next request is received.
3. Otherwise appears similar to a CGI program.

---

```perl
use FCGI;

my $request = FCGI::Request();

while (0 <= $request->Accept()) {
    my $client_ip = $ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'};

    print "Content-Type: text/html\n\n";
    print "Your IP address is ${client_ip}.";
}
```

1. Use `FCGI` and instantiate an object.
2. Loop on `Accept()` which blocks until the next request is received.
3. Otherwise appears similar to a CGI program.

* IPC actually happens over a socket!

???
- Can be run unmodified as a CGI script by detecting that stdin is not a socket.
- Can read from stdin and write to stdout via the miracle of tied filehandles.

---

class:  mod_perl
layout: true

.top-right[
![mod_perl](img/mod_perl.gif)
]

## mod_perl

---

--
- First released on March 25, 1996.

???
- Unlike the interfaces we have examined so far, mod_perl is code.

--
- Became an Apache Software Foundation project at ApacheCon 1999 in Orlando.

--

```perl
package GetIP;

use Apache::RequestRec ();
use Apache::Connection ();
use Apache::Const -compile => qw(OK);

sub handler {
    my $r = shift;
    my $client_ip = $r->connection->remote_addr;

    $r->content_type('text/plain');
    $r->print("Your IP address is ${client_ip}.");
    return Apache::Const::OK;
}

1;
```

???
- There's a separate mod_perl for nginx.

Good:
- Can run CGI programs as-is.

Bad:
- Can tie you to specific web servers.
- Code runs in the same process as the HTTP server -- kinda scary.
- Using Apache's API feels heavy.

```

.col[

.col[
### Response

1. HTTP status code.

???
- Why not a hashref?
  - To support multiple headers (e.g. Set-Cookie)
  - It more closely resembles how the WSGI folks did it (i.e. list of tuples).

---

```perl
my $app = sub {
    my $env = shift;

## Benefits of PSGI

- Everything is a data structure (almost).

???
- Makes it easier to write tests because mocking either the app or server is clear.
- Don't necessarily need to parse a bytestream to check stuff.

--
- No global data or shared IO handles.

???
- This lets you service multiple requests asynchronously in the same process/thread.

--
- Takes deployment details out of web frameworks.

???
- Web frameworks only need to target PSGI.
- No need to worry about the boring stuff; they can focus on the abstractions that make them unique
  and useful.

--
- End-users of your app have many deployment options for free.

class: plack

## Plack

- Provides tools for building, running, and testing PSGI apps.

--
  - [Plack::Handler](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::Handler)

???
- Connects PSGI apps and web servers.
  - Takes a request from the server,
  - converts it to the PSGI-specified environment,
  - runs your app,
  - converts the response back to a format the server understands.

--
  - [Plack::Loader](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::Loader)

???
- Picks an appropriate Plack::Handler (based on ENV, loaded modules, or arguments) and loads it.
- Can also do stuff like restart the loader when files change.

--
  - [Plack::Runner](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::Runner), [plackup](https://metacpan.org/pod/plackup)

???
- Run PSGI apps from the command-line.

--
  - [Plack::Middleware](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::Middleware)

???
- Create subroutines that run between the handler and your app.
- Can alter the request your app receives and modify the response your app returns.

--
  - [Plack::Request](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::Request), [Plack::Response](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::Response)

???
- Request and response wrappers can help simplify writing middleware.

--
  - [Plack::Builder](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::Builder)

???
- Provides DSL for composing apps and middleware.

--
  - [Plack::Test](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::Test), [Plack::Test::Suite](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::Test::Suite)

???
- Use Plack::Test for testing apps.
- Plack::Test::Suite is a series of tests for testing handlers.

  - [Plack::Util](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::Util)

???
- Provides random useful stuff for handler and middleware developers.
- Stuff like determing the length of a document or getting PSGI response headers from the arrayref.

---

class: plackup

## plackup

- Run PSGI apps from the command-line.

```sh
# read your app from app.psgi file
plackup
 
# choose .psgi file from ARGV[0] (or with -a option)
plackup hello.psgi
 
# switch server implementation with --server (or -s)
plackup --server HTTP::Server::Simple --port 9090 --host 127.0.0.1 test.psgi
 
# use UNIX socket to run FCGI daemon
plackup -s FCGI --listen /tmp/fcgi.sock myapp.psgi
 
# launch FCGI external server on port 9090
plackup -s FCGI --port 9090
```

## app.psgi

---

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl

my $app = sub {
    my $env = shift;
    my $client_id = $env->{'REMOTE_ADDR'};

    return [
        '200',
        [ 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain' ],
        [ "Your IP address is ${client_id}." ],
    ];
};
```

---

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl

*use Plack::Builder;

my $app = sub {
    my $env = shift;
    my $client_id = $env->{'REMOTE_ADDR'};

    return [
        '200',
        [ 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain' ],
        [ "Your IP address is ${client_id}." ],
    ];
};

*builder {
*   enable 'Runtime';
*   mount '/' => $app;
*};
```

???
- The `Runtime` middleware adds an `X-Runtime` header to the response with the number of seconds it
  took to process the request.

## Plack Middleware

---

name:   middleware-debug

### [`Debug`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::Middleware::Debug)

```perl
enable 'Debug';
```

---

### [`ReverseProxy`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::Middleware::ReverseProxy)

```perl
enable 'ReverseProxy';
```

- Fixes `REMOTE_ADDR`, `HTTP_HOST`, `SERVER_PORT`, and `psgi.url_scheme` in the environment.

---

### [`LogDispatch`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::Middleware::LogDispatch)

```perl
use Log::Dispatch;

my $logger = Log::Dispatch->new(
    outputs => [
        [
            'Syslog',
            min_level   => 'debug',
            ident       => 'myapp',
        ],
    ],
);

enable 'LogDispatch', logger => $logger;
```

---

### [`XSRFBlock`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::Middleware::XSRFBlock)

```perl
enable 'XSRFBlock', cookie_options => { httponly => 1 };
```

- Blocking cross-site request forgery couldn't be easier.

---

### [`RedirectSSL`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::Middleware::RedirectSSL)

```perl
enable 'RedirectSSL';
```

- Redirects from http to https (or backwards, if configured).
- Can also set HSTS header with configurable `max-age`.

## Parting Thoughts

- PSGI also specifies a way to delay or stream responses to the server.

???
- It's kind of complicated, but you can read the spec to learn more.
- Read the source code of various apps and middlewares to see how it works in practice.

--
- There are tons of great apps and middleware on the CPAN.

--
- Consider writing some of your app as a middleware.

???
- The concept and implementation of middleware is cool.
- You should consider writing parts of your app as middleware so that functionality is available
  under different web frameworks.
- Stuff that makes sense as middleware:
  - Auth mechanisms
  - Logging
  - Error handling
  - Sessions
  - Rate limiters
